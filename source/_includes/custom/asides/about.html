<h2>about me</h2>
<p>Raised in NJ right over the GWB, I escaped the northeast to attend WashU in St. Louis, only to return to the Big Apple (although I loved every minute of STL). After graduation in May '12, I tried to start a business, but had to rely on others to develop. Long story short, that didn't go well, but lesson learned is I have to know how to develop on my own! I've never been more excited for the doors that these soon-to-be newfound skills will open.
